After checking the sequences using AFTOL. I am doing a final check by running them through silva to make sure they are hitting the right sequence. 


```{r librarries}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r read in results}

silva_ssu <- read_csv("Silva_Validation/SSU/arb-silva.de_align_resultlist_1168287.csv")

silva_lsu <- read_csv("Silva_Validation/LSU/arb-silva.de_align_resultlist_1168291.csv")
```

# reblasting everything with a quality below 50. The really low quality ones need to be removed or cleaned but once you get to the 40s, it seems real.
No issues with LSU sequences. 
SAVING THE CLEANED VERSIONS IN THE TEST_SET FOLDER
```{r explore}


silva_ssu %>%
  arrange((quality)) %>%
  select(job_id:identity,quality, lca_tax_slv) %>%
  View()



silva_lsu %>%
  arrange((quality)) %>%
  select(job_id:identity,quality, lca_tax_slv) %>%
  View()



```
